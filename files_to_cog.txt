# ============================
# ==== FILES TO COG ==========
# ============================
# == This file lists all of the files in this project that have pieces
# == that need to be generated and/or preprocessed by "cog" using configurations
# ============================
#
# this is the general relativity definition file
#include/grDef.h

# RHS set-up for evolution equations:
solver/src/rhs.cpp

# physcon.cpp is the physical conditions file (deals with psi, ham, and mom)
#src/physcon.cpp

# and then the KO calculation to be used
#gencode/solver_rhs_ko_deriv_calc.cpp.inc

# then evolution constraints need to be generated
#include/system_constraints.h

# we also need to generate the parameters
#src/parameters.cpp
#include/parameters.h
